The `getting-started` project is a simple Jakarta EE application with a HTTP endpoint that is running in
https://wildfly.org[WildFly].

The `src/main` folder contains a simple 'Hello world' style Jakarta EE application using JAX-RS.

== Building the application

To run the application, you use Maven:

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean package

Maven will compile the application, provision a WildFly server
The WildFly server is created in `target/server` with the application deployed in it.

== Running the application

To run the application, run the commands:

[source,shell]
----
cd target/server
./bin/standalone.sh
----

Once WildFly is running, the application can be accessed at http://localhost:8080/

== Testing the application

To run integration tests to verify the application, you use Maven:

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean package verify
----

Tests in `src/test` are run against the server in `target/server`.

[source,shell]
----
podman build -t my-jaxrs-app:latest .
